# Minesweeper

The classic game of Minesweeper, implemented using web technologies. The game does not use any external image files. All UI elements, including the field, the mines and the flags, are rendered directly by the browser.

The game features:

* 3 predefined difficulty levels
* Support for tile flagging to mark the ones, which might contain mines
* Cheat mode, which reveals the locations of the mines without ending the game
* Autosave, which preserves the state of the game on exit and allows to continue from the exact same place on return

Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3 Shapes
* CSS3 Gradients
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* jQuery Cookie

To experience all the game features, including gradients and autosave, the recent versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari should be used. The game, however, degrades well on older versions of these and other browsers, including IE and Opera. One thing to remember when the game is run locally in Chrome: file cookies should be enabled for autosave to work.
