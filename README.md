# Minesweeper

The classic game of Minesweeper, implemented using modern web technologies. The game does not use any external
image files. All UI elements, including the field, the mines and the flags, are rendered directly by the
browser. The demo is available [on the project web page](https://continuum.lv/projects/minesweeper/).

The game features:

* 3 difficulty levels;
* support for tile flagging — mark the ones, which might contain mines;
* cheat mode — reveal the locations of the mines without ending the game;
* autosave — preserve the state of the game on exit and continue from the exact same place on return.

Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3 Shapes
* CSS3 Gradients
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* jQuery Cookie

To experience all the game features, including gradients and autosave, moderately recent versions of Chrome,
Firefox or Safari should be used. One thing to remember when the game is run locally in Chrome: file cookies
must be enabled for autosave to work.
